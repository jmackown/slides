                        There is a concept in Agile called "The Prime Directive". 
                        It was designed to be used in retrospectives, but I think it
                        has a broader application, across all areas of work and life.
                        The concept is:

                        Why is this important though?
                        I don't know what you all do for work, but I am a full stack developer.
                        My job requires a lot of creativitiy, regardless of the specific
                        domain I am working in at that moment. I also work within a team of 
                        equally intillegent, creative people.
                        <br />
                        In order to work together, we have to approach work with a positive mindset.
                        We have to work in an atmophere where people are free to present idea, where
                        we trust each other and can be open with advice or cricisisms. 
                        Most importantly, we need to build a blame-free culture, where no one 
                        is afraid make mistakes.

                        This is actually really hard to do

                        It's human nature to find someone to blame when things go wrong.
                        In the moment, it's cathartic - especially if it's not YOUR fault!
                        <br />
                        You're destroying your team's morale, you are wasting energy
                        not actually fixing the problem
                        and you are displaying a staggering amount of arrogance, by assuming that
                        someone just doesn't know what they're doing. You don't know what was
                        going on at at the time. To assume you automatically know better is 
                        incredibly patronising.
                        <br />
                        The Code might look bad to an outsider, but given the circumstances, 
                        it might be the perfect solution....
                        And here's a few examples!

                        It discounts the whole process that person wrote to get to that
                        solution - there may have been some circumstances you are not aware of.
                        More importantly, it doesn't actually solve the problem.
